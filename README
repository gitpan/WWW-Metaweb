WWW::Metaweb version 0.02
=========================

** WWW::Metaweb **

WWW::Metaweb provides an interface to a Metaweb database instance. The
best example currently is Freebase (www.freebase.com). Queries to a
Metaweb are made through HTTP requests to the Metaweb API.

Qeueries are written in the Metaweb Query Language (MQL), using
Javascript Object Notation (JSON). WWW::Metaweb allows you to write the
actual JSON string yourself or provide a Perl array ref / hash ref
structure to be converted to JSON.

As of this release Freebase required a (free) username and password to
access, if any of this sounds interesting go check it out at:
